With the Kubernetes integration, you can gain valuable insights into the health and performance of your containerized applications. The pre-configured dashboards and visualizations help you monitor key metrics, track resource utilization, and identify potential issues within your Kubernetes clusters. This integration empowers you to efficiently manage your containerized workloads, scale applications as needed, and ensure the reliability and availability of your Kubernetes environment.
